## Simple Web Scraper

A simple webscraper written in Python for retrieving the contents of an online directory listing. If you start a Python server on your machine, it'll retrieve the contents of that directory and write them to a local CSV file. You can start a server quickly using this:

```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```
